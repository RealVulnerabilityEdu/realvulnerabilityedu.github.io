# Number of Solorigate-related hashes as literals is above the threshold
This query detects literals that look like Solorigate Hash values used in the Solorigate code.

This query detects when the code includes at least 5 of the Hash literals used in the Solorigate tampered code

Please notice that by themselves these literals are not malign, but several of the values together would be less likely to be coincidental.

The nation-state supply chain attack on SolarWinds known as Solorigate or SunBurst gave nation-state actors access to some victims' networks.

The purpose of these rules is to identify potentially tampered code that requires further analysis.


## Recommendation
Any findings from this rule are only intended to indicate suspicious code that shares similarities with known portions of code used for the Solorigate attack. There is no certainty that the code is related or that the code is part of any attack.
