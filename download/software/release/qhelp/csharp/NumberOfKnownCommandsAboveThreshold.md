# Number of Solorigate-related command names in enum is above the threshold
This query detects enumerations that include various commands that were also used in the Solorigate implant.

By themselves, the names of these enumeration constants are not malicious, so the query only detects enumerations that includes at least 10 of the 18 Solorigate commands.

The nation-state supply chain attack on SolarWinds known as Solorigate or SunBurst gave nation-state actors access to some victims' networks.

The purpose of these rules is to identify potentially tampered code that requires further analysis.


## Recommendation
Any findings from this rule are only intended to indicate suspicious code that shares similarities with known portions of code used for the Solorigate attack. There is no certainty that the code is related or that the code is part of any attack.
