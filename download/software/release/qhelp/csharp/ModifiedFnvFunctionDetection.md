# Detects a modified FNV function
In Solorigate, the malicious code tried to evade various security detection software by comparing hashes of the process names against an embedded list of values. The malicious code used in the SolarWinds attack included hash values calculated using a standard FNV-1A 64-bit hash with an additional XOR by a literal after computing the FNV-1A.

This query detects FNV-like hash calculations where there is an additional XOR (with any static value) after the hash calculation loop.

The nation-state supply chain attack on SolarWinds known as Solorigate or SunBurst gave nation-state actors access to some victims' networks.

The purpose of these rules is to identify potentially tampered code that requires further analysis.


## Recommendation
Any findings from this rule are only intended to indicate suspicious code that shares similarities with known portions of code used for the Solorigate attack. There is no certainty that the code is related or that the code is part of any attack.
