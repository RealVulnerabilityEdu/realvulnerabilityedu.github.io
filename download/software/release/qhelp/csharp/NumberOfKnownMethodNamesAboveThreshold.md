# Number of Solorigate-related method names is above the threshold
This query detects method names used in the Solorigate code.

This query detects when the code includes at least 50 of the methods used in the Solorigate tampered code

Please notice that by themselves these method names are not malign.

The nation-state supply chain attack on SolarWinds known as Solorigate or SunBurst gave nation-state actors access to some victims' networks.

The purpose of these rules is to identify potentially tampered code that requires further analysis.


## Recommendation
Any findings from this rule are only intended to indicate suspicious code that shares similarities with known portions of code used for the Solorigate attack. There is no certainty that the code is related or that the code is part of any attack.
