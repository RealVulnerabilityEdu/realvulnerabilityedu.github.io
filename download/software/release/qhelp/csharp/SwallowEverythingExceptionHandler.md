# Looks for use of a Swallow Everything empty catch block
In Solorigate, the malicious code was wrapped in generic exception catch blocks that lacked any statements. This made it harder to find any suspicious runtime exceptions.

This query detects all generic exception empty catch blocks, but it is strongly suggested that the results for cs/catch-of-all-exceptions also be reviewed in the event that a malicious swallow everything exception handler was not empty

The nation-state supply chain attack on SolarWinds known as Solorigate or SunBurst gave nation-state actors access to some victims' networks.

The purpose of these rules is to identify potentially tampered code that requires further analysis.


## Recommendation
Any findings from this rule are only intended to indicate suspicious code that shares similarities with known portions of code used for the Solorigate attack. There is no certainty that the code is related or that the code is part of any attack.
