  - title: Mapping CS Curriculum Topiocs to Known Vulnerabilities
    desc: >-
      In this effort, we are establishing a mapping between the ACM/IEEE model
      CS curriculum and the known vulnerabilities. The mapping is released as a
      web application that allows users to explore the mapping. At present, a
      partial mapping is established between several topics in the ACM/IEEE CS
      2013 Curricululm and the known vulnerabilities in terms of the Common
      Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE).

          We are looking for volunteers to help us complete the mapping and to improve 
          the mapping Web application. If you are
          interested, please feel free to send in a pull request on Github or contact us.

  - title: Secure Programming Course Modules using Real-World Vulnerabilities
    desc: >-
      In this effort, we are creating a set of course modules that can be used
      to teach secure programming using real-world vulnerabilities. The modules
      are realeased on a rolling basis.

          The modules are currently under development. If you want to contribute, 
          please feel free to contact us. In the near future, we will release
          the course modules in a public Github repository.
