   The primary objective in programming is to devise a solution for a specific problem. However, while the solution may address the problem at hand, it is critical to acknowledge the possibility of overlooked security vulnerabilities. One significant source of these potential security issues, including unauthorized access to sensitive information, is Improper Input Validation. Improper Input Validation occurs when a program fails to adequately verify the inputs it receives.
