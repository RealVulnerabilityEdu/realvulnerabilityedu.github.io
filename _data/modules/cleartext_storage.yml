title: CWE-312 Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (feedbacksystem)
status: released
location: /modules/cleartext_storage_cve_2023_37468/
desc: >-
  An application stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource
  that might be accessible to another control sphere. Because the information is
  stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it.
  Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable,
  certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode
  the information. Particularly, when organizations adopt cloud services, it can
  be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet. An
  example application that contained this weakness:
software:
  - title: Feedbacksystem
    desc: >-
      A personalized feedback system for students. A student makes numerous
      submissions for tasks received in a class. Rather than just giving a pass
      or fail, the application is a system that can give students more
      granulated feedback. For the students, the system can check students'
      submissions, provide suggestions about the msitakes found in the
      submission. For the instructors, the system can collect the most common
      mistakes and present them to the instructors.
